<h1 align="center">LeetCode Sol2utions</h1>
  
🤓 **`What is LeetCode?`**    
  - LeetCode is a site that allows developers to practice commonly asked interview questions that test their coding abilitys.  

😁 **`Why upload your solutions here? why not on LeetCode?`**  
- When doing a LeetCode problem you can view the soltuions to the problem you are up against, this repo serves as a large scale hub of solutions for anyone to study or source code from.    

😠 **`Do I need to credit you?`**  
- No need! I only upload here for daily github activity, I do 1 or more LeetCodes a day, I already get enough out of it this way.
